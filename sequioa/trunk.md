# Trunk

The core of our beautiful application.

## Bark

The layer that protects our application from external threats.

### Increased thickness

Greatly improve resistance to overheating in fire situation.

### Reduced sap content

Keeping the `bark` dry means we leave less opporunities for things to catch on fire.

## Water storage

All evidence indicates that tree trunk internal water storage contributes from 6 to 28% of the daily water budget of large trees depending on the species.
