# Trunk

The core of our beautiful application.


## Bark

The layer that protects our application from external threats.

### Increased thickness

Greatly improve resistance to overheating in fire situation.

### Redcuded sap content

Keeping the `bark` dry means we leave less opporunities for things to catch on fire.


## Knot

This is really annoying.
