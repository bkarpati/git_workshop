# Trunk

The core of our beautiful application.


## Bark

The layer that protects our application from external threats.

### Increased thickness

Greatly improve resistance to overheating in fire situation.

### Reduced sap content

Keeping the `bark` dry means we leave less opporunities for things to catch on fire.

### Increase moss volume

Adding moss on the `bark` help retaining more humidity.
